* Introduction

Archaeology's radiocarbon revolution has been a blessing and a curse
for archaeologists working in Hawai`i.  When the method was first
applied in the early 1950's it appeared to offer a scientific way to
measure time that would be an improvement over relative dating methods
that had yielded poorly in Hawai`i
[[parencite:dye10:_tradit_hawaiian_surfac_archit]].  In practice,
however, many of the \rc\space age determinations returned by dating
laboratories proved difficult to interpret sensibly.  Over the years,
archaeologists have responded with a variety of interpretive schemes,
all of them ad hoc in the sense that they are not based on an explicit
chronological model.  Ad hoc interpretive schemes are certainly
capable of yielding good results, but the history of their application
in Hawaii is symptomatic of an unscientific method.  This is perhaps
easiest to see in the case of Polynesian colonization, a question that
has been at the forefront of archaeological research in Hawai`i since
the dawn of the radiocarbon revolution.  In science, a properly
formulated solution yields increasingly accurate and precise results
as the number of relevant observations grows.  In contrast, the ad hoc
interpretive approaches have disdained precision, proposing
colonization date estimates without corresponding error terms, and
have failed to converge on a solution
[[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii][;]].  Ad hoc
estimates of the colonization event proposed over the last two decades
range over an eye-opening 1,200 years.

This paper argues that the failure of ad hoc interpretive methods is
systemic.  Statements about what happened in old Hawai`i based on ad
hoc interpretations often reflect failures of the method more than
they do events in the past.  An example is a general statement about
sequences of agricultural development across the archipelago.
#+begin_quote
\ldots\ the chronological development of the Kohala, Kona, Waimea,
Kahikinui, and Kalaupapa field systems, spanning three islands, is
remarkably congruent.  While there was some low intensity land use in
Kohala and Kona prior to AD 1400, in all cases the onset of major
dryland cultivation began around AD 1400.  Following about two
centuries of development, a final phase of intensification, typically
marked by highly formalized garden plots and territorial boundaries,
commenced about AD 1600 to 1650, and continued until the early
postcontact period.  Unlike the irrigation systems, many of which have
continued in use throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
the dryland field systems were all rapidly abandoned within a few
decades following European contact.
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][153;]]
#+end_quote
This statement is part of a larger argument about the chronology of
changes in /ali`i/ authority
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][77 ff.;]], which has its basis
in interpretations of traditions that were transmitted by the ruling
/ali`i/, and which served to legitimate their rule.  The period
boundaries for agricultural development define evenly-spaced,
approximately two century, intervals that link features of the
contact-era political situation with origination points identified by
interpretation of the traditions.  The "onset of major dryland
cultivation" in AD 1400 is when some scholars believe the traditions
become historically accurate, in the western sense of that term
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][81;]].  In this interpretation
of the traditions, /ali`i/ history begins around AD 1400.  The "final
phase of intensification" around AD 1600 marks the first Gregorian
century in which the traditions are interpreted to indicate that
Hawai`i and Maui Islands were both ruled by paramounts. The Hawai`i
Island /ali`i/, `Umi a L\=iloa, whose reign was later used to
legitimate Kamehameha the Great's usurpation of the Hawai`i Island
paramountcy on his way to uniting the islands, ruled at about this
time.  Thus, field system developments are seen as congruent
among themselves and also with a particular interpretation of the
development of political authority in traditional Hawai`i.

It is argued here that congruences such as these are, in part,
artifacts of the ad hoc methods used to interpret the dating evidence.
Ad hoc methods spawn two kinds of errors, both of which bolster the
appearance of congruence.  First, their disdain for uncertainty
conceals the fact that age estimates for some key events are very
imprecise.  In these cases, linking the archaeological record to a
precise time doesn't constitute archaeological support for a
particular hypothesis.  Rather, it reflects an assumption of the
hypothesis to shore up weaknesses in the archaeological results.
Second, the ad hoc methods operate outside a coherent statistical
framework and are typically wasteful of chronological information.
They yield relatively weak results.  Precise results with the
potential to distinguish one chronology from another are thus kept out
of reach, leaving the impression of congruence intact.

This general argument is made by way of a specific example, a
model-based calibration and re-interpretation of the developmental
chronology of a portion of the Leeward Kohala Field System on Hawai`i
Island.  The Leeward Kohala Field System offers a unique opportunity
in this regard.  As [[textcite:rosendahl72]] pointed out many years
ago, the fabric-like structure of the field system---trails that
connect the field system to the coast provide the warp for the weft of
agricultural walls that divide fields from one another---yields an
opportunity to establish relative ages of features at every
intersection of a wall with a trail.  Within this rich mesh of
chronologically ordered construction events,
[[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]] have carried out a
sophisticated dating program that specifically excavated beneath
agricultural walls and under curbstones of trails to identify termini
post quem for wall and curb construction events.  The detailed dating
record they have produced offers analytic opportunities unmatched in
Hawaiian archaeology.  It is the only dating record from the Leeward
Kohala Field System capable of yielding the analytic precision
required to evaluate the proposed temporal congruence.

This rich set of data is analyzed here with Bayesian methods
[[parencite:buck96][;]], which build a detailed chronological model of
field system development from the stratigraphic relations of the
agricultural walls and trails, and then fix this model in time with
the \rc\space age determinations.  The \rc\space age determinations
from the field system are generally quite young and their combination
with the detailed chronological model yields results that are more
precise than typically achieved in Hawai`i.  The precision of the
results adds strength to the observation that they are not congruent
with the chronology of political development yielded by the
interpretation of /ali`i/ traditions.  Instead of the steady march of
change implied by the ad hoc interpretation, the Bayesian analysis
indicates that the tempo of change varied over time.  Much of what we
recognize today as the field system---most of the walls and many of
the trails---was built during a brief pulse of intensification at the
end of the sequence.  In fact, much of the construction appears to
have taken place within the historic period, which suggests that
contingent events might have played a larger role in agricultural
development than the interpretation of ali`i traditions would lead one
to expect.

* Relative Chronology of Field System Development

The relative chronology of field system development in the detailed
study area (fig. \ref{fig:diagram}) has been addressed in two
publications \parencites
[[multicite:ladefoged03:_archaeol_eviden_for_agric_devel][;]]
[[multicite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][;]].  In these cases, the
field system features were assigned to building phases or temporal
units, two similar analytic constructs that group features based on
stratigraphic relations and a set of propositions or assumptions
independent of the stratigraphic relations (fig. \ref{fig:building}).
The chronological model used in the Bayesian calibration is based
solely on stratigraphic relations, so it can't be based on the
published building phases or temporal units.

[[file:Ladefoged_and_Graves_2008_fig_7.jpg]]

Accordingly, a Harris matrix
[[parencite:harris89:_princ_archaeol_strat]] that illustrates the
known stratigraphic relations of the dated field system
features was constructed (fig. \ref{fig:digraph}).  In addition to the
dated field system features, also included in the Harris matrix are
undated features that show the relative stratigraphic relations of
dated features that don't intersect one another, but whose
relationship can be determined with the map evidence.  Figure
\ref{fig:digraph} thus represents the components of the full Harris
matrix for the detailed study area needed to construct a chronological
model for the Bayesian calibration.  This figure represents the
chronological model that distinguishes Bayesian from ad hoc
interpretations.

Figure \ref{fig:digraph} is a directed acyclic graph, also known in
the literature as a DAG or an acyclic digraph.  The properties of
DAG's are well known and graph theory has developed terminology that
makes it possible to talk about them in a precise way
[[parencite:hage83:_models][65 ff.;]].  This can be a tremendous advantage
when trying to conceptualize and work with a structure as large and
complex as the detailed study area (fig. \ref{fig:diagram}).  It would
appear to be essential to any attempt to deal with larger sections of
the field system or to comprehend the field system whole.

The properties of a DAG make it an ideal graph structure to represent
a Harris matrix.  A DAG consists of a finite set of /points/ and a
collection of ordered pairs of points, known as /arcs/
[[parencite:hage83:_models][68;]].  The /directed/ property of the DAG
refers to the fact that each arc consists of an ordered pair of
points, or a direction that runs from the first point to the
second point.  In the context of a Harris matrix, the
direction of an arc encodes the stratigraphic relation "older
than/younger than."  In Figure \ref{fig:digraph}, the arrows used for
the arcs of the graph point from an older feature to a younger
feature; each arrow represents an observed stratigraphic relationship
at the intersection of a trail and a wall.  The /acyclic/ property of
the DAG means that there is no sequence of points and arcs, where the
points of each arc are in order, that starts and ends at the same
point.  The lack of cycles in the graph ensures that no feature can be
either older or younger than itself, which is a requirement of the
stratigraphic model.

[[file:lkfs-dag.pdf]]



Figure \ref{fig:digraph} is laid out with the arrows pointing down, so
older features are at the top of the graph and younger features are at
the bottom.  The structure of the graph, with alternating rows of
walls and trails, reflects the nature of the evidence; none of the
walls cross another wall, and none of the trails cross another trail.
Two features are related chronologically if and only if one is
/reachable/ from the other; two points in a digraph are reachable if
it is possible to move from one to the other in the direction of the
arcs.  Walls /g/ and /d/, for instance, are reachable from the
same set of features, which includes walls /c/, /i/, /j/, /k/, and /h/
and trails /B/ and /C/.  They are not, however, reachable from one
another.  Thus, although the stratigraphic relations indicate that
both walls are younger than trail /C/, it is not possible to tell on
the basis of the relative stratigraphic information which of the two
was built before the other.

The graph of figure \ref{fig:digraph} is /weakly connected/ because it
contains pairs of points that are not reachable from one another.
This occurs fairly frequently in situations like the one discussed
above with walls /d/ and /g/, where the walls are physically close to
one another and share similar stratigraphic relations to neighboring
trails.  It also occurs frequently with walls on opposite sides of a
trail.  For example, walls /d/ and /e/ are both younger than trail
/B/, but it is not possible to determine on stratigraphic grounds
which of the walls is older than the other.  It is true that wall /e/
is older than trail /A/ and that wall /d/ is younger than trail /C/,
but there is no stratigraphic information on the relative ages of
trails /A/ and /C/, so this information does not yield a temporal
order for the two walls.  The fact that the periodization of Figure
\ref{fig:building} assigns relative ages to these two walls, and to
others that share similar stratigraphic relations, is an indication
that the building phases it proposes are not strictly chronological.

These two examples of weak connections are both local in scope.
However, weak connections also occur at points that distinguish larger
sections of the field system, and these might provide clues to the
history of development.  The prime example of this in the detailed
study area is wall /b/.  None of the points that reach wall /b/ from
the left hand side of Figure \ref{fig:digraph} is reachable from any
of the points that reach wall /b/ from the right hand side of the
figure.  Thus the stratigraphic structure of the detailed study area
is broken between trails /C/ and /D/ in Kahua 1.

Figure \ref{fig:digraph} provides the information needed to group
features with similar stratigraphic relations for the Bayesian
calibration; the groups are indicated on the figure by labeled
rectangles.  In graph theory, the points of an arc are said to be
/adjacent/ to one another; the first point is /adjacent to/ the second
point, and the second point is /adjacent from/ the first point.
Features have been grouped for the calibration analysis if and only if
they are adjacent to and/or from the same point(s).  Thus, walls /c/,
/i/, /j/, and /k/ are grouped with one another because they are
adjacent to trail /B/, walls /l/ and /a/ are grouped because both are
adjacent from trail /A/, and walls /e/ and /f/ are grouped because both
are adjacent from trail /B/ and adjacent to trail /A/.  This procedure
ensures that features included in a group are strictly comparable to
one another according to the relative stratigraphic information.

* \rc\space Dating of Field System Features

Table \ref{tab:dates} lists 21 of the 25 \rc\space age determinations
associated with agricultural features in Leeward Kohala Field System
published by [[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][Table 1;]].  It
includes all 17 \rc\space age determinations from the detailed study
area at P\=ahinahina and Kahua 1, along with four of the eight
\rc\space age determinations from features outside the detailed study
area.  All of the age determinations in the table are on short-lived
materials.  The four excluded \rc\space age determinations are on
materials identified as dicot wood.  They were excluded because of the
potential in-built age carried by this material.  The \rc\space age
determinations all derive from archaeological contexts that "date
activities that occurred before the construction of the agricultural
walls" or that "pre-date the construction of the trails"
[[parencite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][778;]].

Table \ref{tab:dates} provides the label assigned to the age
determination by [[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]] in the last
column, the label assigned by the dating laboratory in column 4, the
wall or trail feature with which the age determination is associated,
keyed to Figure \ref{fig:diagram}, in column 2, and the calibration
group to which the determination has been assigned in column 3.  The
values in the first column, labeled \theta, identify the age
determinations in the Bayesian analysis. Technically, in the Bayesian
model each \theta represents the true calendar age of the sample,
which is estimated by the corresponding \rc\space age determination.
The values in the table start with \theta_8 and run through \theta_28.
This is because the field system calibration is carried out in the
context of an estimate of when the islands were initially colonized by
Polynesians, which requires seven age determinations assigned to
\theta_{1 \dots 7} [[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii][;]].  The column labeled "Outlier" is an analytic result, discussed
below.

A striking feature of Table \ref{tab:dates} is that most of the
\rc\space age determinations are relatively young.  This is the case
even for \rc\space age determinations associated with the oldest
features in the detailed study area.  Two of the \rc\space age
determinations associated with Group 1 walls are less than 300
\rc\space years old, and the youngest of these, associated with wall
/c/, dates to 200 \pm 40 BP.  The sample collected from beneath the
curbstone of the oldest trail, trail /B/, dates to 130 \pm 30 BP.
Keeping in mind that these \rc\space age determinations pre-date
construction of the associated features, and that the field system was
abandoned "within a few decades following European contact"
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][153;]], or about 100 BP, it
would appear that most of the features in the detailed study area were
built within the span of about 100 \rc\space years.

Because a 100 \rc\space year span seems too brief for construction of
the field system facilities, an analysis was performed to identify
outliers among the \rc\space age determinations
[[parencite:christen94:_summar_set_of_radioc_deter]].  The expectation was
that the young age determinations associated with the oldest features
would be identified as outliers and could be removed from the
calibration.  The results of the outlier analysis are presented in
column 6 of Table \ref{tab:dates} as the difference between an
uninformative prior probability assigned to each \rc\space age
determination and the posterior probability returned by the analysis.
Negative numbers indicate \rc\space age determinations that are less
likely to be outliers than was estimated by the prior probability and
positive numbers indicate \rc\space age determinations that are more
likely to be outliers.  The outlier identification procedure doesn't
establish a metric for how big this difference must be for a \rc\space
age determination to be considered an outlier.  In practice, the
analyst uses the results to draw attention to particular \rc\space age
determinations and these are scrutinized as necessary before a
decision is made either to keep them in the analysis or discard them
as outliers.

The results of the outlier analysis indicate that there is no reason
to question the integrity of most of the age determinations.  The
young age determination from under the curbstone of trail /B/ and the
age determination associated with wall /i/ in Group 1 are not
outliers.  The only age determination possibly indicated by the
analysis as an outlier is the age determination associated with wall
/c/.  [[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][779;]] don't discuss this
particular age determination and it appears not to have played a role
in their interpretation of the dating results.  However, there are
several reasons why this age determination should not be treated as
an outlier:
   1. the dating model typically has few age determinations per group
      and this makes outlier determination less reliable than it would
      be with more samples;
   2. the result returned by the outlier analysis is not particularly
      strong---the prior probability of 0.1 increased to 0.3, about a
      quarter of the possible maximum;
   3. the \rc\space age determination is only 90 \rc\space years
      younger than the next youngest sample from beneath a Group 1
      wall;
   4. the \rc\space age determination associated with the feature
      immediately younger than it, trail /B/, is stratigraphically
      correct and about 70 \rc\space years younger than it; and
   5. charcoal from the later swidden activities might be relatively
      rare if, as appears to be the case, secondary growth
      were consistently used as a source of mulch, or if burned
      secondary growth consisted mostly of grasses [[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][53;]].  
On balance, then, there appears to be no compelling reason to discard
this age determination as an outlier.  However, this is an issue that
might repay identification and dating of additional samples from
beneath Group 1 walls.

* Developmental Periods and Their Boundaries

The history of the Leeward Kohala Field System is typically described
according to a theory of agricultural development that distinguishes
processes of expansion and intensification
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings,ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii,ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system]].
The process of expansion involves "conversion of previously unused
areas to cultivation"
[[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][95;]].  It is recognized
archaeologically beneath the oldest field system walls in units of
stratification that "show clear signs of clearing or cultivation, such
as digging stick holes, churned sediments, and charcoal lenses or
flecking" [[parencite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][778;]].  The process of
intensification increases "the amount of labor in a fixed area of land
to increase production"
[[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][95;]].  It is recognized
archaeologically by construction of the field system walls.  In use,
the walls were typically planted with sugar cane which helped them
serve as windbreaks, which increased yields by protecting crops from
the famous Kohala winds and reducing evapotranspiration
[[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][94;]].

The periods of expansion and intensification can be augmented with two
additional periods that set the Leeward Kohala Field System within the
framework of a first-order cultural sequence for Hawai`i.  The first
of these embraces the time between Polynesian colonization and the
onset of agricultural expansion.  The land that would later become the
Leeward Kohala field system lay undeveloped and was either unused or
used so lightly that archaeologists are unable to detect it.  At the
other end of the sequence is the time since the field system was
abandoned in the mid-nineteenth century.  Historically, use of the
area during this period was for cattle ranching, but other commercial
activities have been attempted, all of them made possible by the
introduction of certain property rights and the alienability of land
during the Mahele
[[parencite:chinen58:mahele,moffat95:_survey_mahel,banner05:_prepar_colon,chinen02:_they_cried_help]].
For ease of reference, the periods are here labeled Colonization,
Expansion, Intensification, and Alienation.  The model was calibrated
with the BCal software package [[parencite:bcal]].

Estimates of the period boundaries yielded by the Bayesian calibration
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:periods}.  The colonization event is
based on model (3) of
[[textcite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii]], which includes a
\rc\space age determination on rat bone from the `Ewa Plain that did
not control for the possibility of a marine component in the rat's
diet that would make the bone appear too old.  Model (3) was used
because it yields a relatively precise estimate of the colonization
event, but one which maintains the central tendency of the
less-precise estimate without the rat bone date
[[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii]].  Still, the 67%
highest posterior density region of the estimate, analogous to the one
standard deviation error term of frequentist statistics, covers almost
two centuries.  The 95% HPD region, analogous to two standard
deviations, spans more than three centuries.  The distribution is
centered around AD 980 and is relatively symmetrical.

The estimate for the beginning of the Expansion period is slightly
more precise than the estimate of the Colonization period.  The 67%
HPD covers about 120 years and the 95% HPD about 280 years.  The
central tendency of the distribution is clearly within the fourteenth
century; probabilities drop off quickly after AD 1400, and the long,
low early tail takes in the eleventh through thirteenth centuries.

The precision of the estimate improves markedly in the Intensification
period, due primarily to the constraints imposed by chronological
relations of the field system features (fig. \ref{fig:digraph}).
Given the model and current evidence, the 67% HPD covers 90 years and
the 95% HPD 210 years.  The distribution has a marked peak around AD
1680 that falls rapidly in the eighteenth century but has a long, low
early tail that extends through the sixteenth century.

The estimate for the Alienation period is included on Figure
\ref{fig:periods} for the sake of completeness.  This period boundary
is a floating parameter in the model that was modeled as a normal
curve with a ten year standard deviation centered at AD 1850.  Land
records from the Mahele appear to indicate that the field system was
abandoned by the middle of the nineteenth century.  In any event,
archaeological excavations in the field system did not yield
information on the abandonment event, so the estimate yielded by the
Bayesian calibration is mainly a reflection of the prior probability.


Estimates for the construction of facilities within the detailed study
area are shown in Figure \ref{fig:features} and the precisions of the
estimates are listed in Table \ref{tab:facility}.  The high precision
of these estimates is due to the many constraints yielded by the
stratigraphic relations of the trails and walls
(fig. \ref{fig:digraph}) and to the apparent brevity of the
Intensification period.  The estimate for Group 1 is also the estimate
for the onset of Intensification and was discussed earlier.  Group 2
dates construction of the curb along trail /B/, which marks the
boundary between P\=ahinahina and Kahua 1.  This trail appears to have
been built early in the eighteenth century.  The distribution of the
estimate is centered on AD 1720, with a 67% HPD region that spans 60
years.  The P\=ahinahina agricultural walls /e/ and /f/, in Group 3,
are estimated to have been constructed around the middle of the
eighteenth century.  The distribution of the estimate is centered on
AD 1760.  The 67% HPD region spans 70 years.  Trail C, in Kahua 1, but
structurally associated with features in P\=ahinahina, appears to have
been built around the turn of the nineteenth century.  The 67% HPD
region for this event spans 60 years.  Finally, the two P\=ahinahina
walls in Group 5a and the two Kahua 1 walls in Group 5b are estimated
to be penecontemporaneous.  The estimates for these two groups both
peak around AD 1840 and both have 67% HPD regions that span 50 years.

* Tempo of Change

An alternative view of the calibration results takes the focus away
from estimates of period boundaries and puts it instead on estimates
of period duration.  Figure \ref{fig:tempo} shows duration estimates
for the Colonization, Expansion, Intensification, and Alienation
periods.

The Colonization and Expansion periods are both relatively long, on
the order of 3--5 centuries, and imprecisely estimated, with 67% HPD
regions between 160 and 260 years.  In contrast, the
Intensification and Alienation periods are relatively short.  Most of
the difference in their durations is due to a convention of \rc\space
dating that defines Present as AD 1950.  Adding an extra 60 years to
the length of the Alienation period would shift its distribution to
the right and bring it almost precisely in line with the
Intensification period.  Duration estimates for both periods are
relatively precise, although, as noted above, uncertainty in the
duration of the Alienation period is mostly an artifact of the model's
assumptions.

* Discussion

The extended quote in section [[Introduction]]
[[parencite:kirch10:_how_chief_becam_kings][153;]] is structured as an
origin narrative.  Like other origin narratives it has two goals---to
establish the plausibility of the events and processes it projects
onto the past, and to claim authority by locating them at particular
times [[parencite:moore95:_probl_of_origin][;]].  This particular
origin narrative identifies the processes of agricultural expansion
and intensification and fixes their origins at AD 1400 and 1600--1650,
two times that an interpretation of tradition finds important in the
rise of /ali`i/ authority.  The regularity of the process identified
in the narrative---200 years of expansion followed by 200 years of
intensification into the early historic period---gives it an aura of
inevitability, as if the present were predicted by the origin events
in its past.  Bayesian calibration yields the precise dating results
with which to evaluate these claims about agricultural development, at
least in a portion of the Leeward Kohala Field System.  

The expansion process, whose origin is described as "the onset of
major dryland cultivation" is hypothesized to have originated about
AD 1400.  This is a time when land was cleared for cultivation of
sweet potato, a crop plant that originated in America and was
introduced to Eastern Polynesia by voyagers who made the return trip
to the coast of South America
[[parencite:storey07:_radioc_and_dna_eviden_for]].  On present
evidence, it was introduced to Hawai`i some 3--6 centuries after the
islands were colonized
[[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii][Table 2;]].
Excavations in the Leeward Kohala Field System collected a charred
tuber tentatively identified as sweet potato that represents the
earliest dated occurrence of the plant in Hawai`i
[[parencite:ladefoged05:_introd_sweet_potat_polyn]].  The \rc\space
age determination for this probable sweet potato tuber, Beta-208143,
is the oldest from the field system (table \ref{tab:dates}), and thus
marks the onset of the Expansion period.
[[textcite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][779;]] interpreted
this information as placing the start of the Expansion period "as
early as AD 1290 but certainly by AD 1430."  The Bayesian calibration
relies on the same evidence for its estimate and gives a similar
result; stratigraphic relations that might constrain the calibrated
age of this sample are absent.  The date of AD 1400 for the expansion
process singled out by the origin narrative falls at the late end of
this range. It is a plausible estimate for the onset of the Expansion
period, but it is only one of very many plausible estimates. The
calibration results from the detailed study area are equally
"congruent" with an origin of the Expansion period anytime in the
fourteenth century or even a bit earlier.  The archaeological
information is less certain than the origin narrative implies.  In
this case, the origin narrative is imposing its structure on the
archaeological data rather than the other way round.

The second process identified in the origin narrative is "a final
phase of intensification" that "commenced about AD 1600 to 1650."
This range of dates is at odds with the interpretation put forward by
[[textcite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system]], who believed the
intensification started earlier.  They assign early construction dates
to walls /j/ and /k/ in Group 1 based on the presence of relatively
old charcoal beneath them.  In their view, this puts the start of the
Intensification period "as early as AD 1410 but possibly not until AD
1630" [[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][779;]].  This
inference appears to be based on a logical error, however.  It is only
possible to know that the charcoal collected under a wall is older
than the wall; it is not possible to know, in the absence of other
information, /how much/ older it is.  The Bayesian calibration
corrects this logical error and yields a much later estimate.
According to it, the intensification process got underway in AD
1640--1729, about a half century later than the range hypothesized by
the origin narrative.  This disparity grows when the pace of
intensification is considered.  At least three analyses have indicated
that most of the wall construction effort in the Leeward Kohala Field
System was concentrated in the later phases of wall building
[[parencite:ladefoged00:_kohala_fields,ladefoged03:_archaeol_eviden_for_agric_devel,ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]].
This trend can be seen clearly in the detailed study area in the walls
related stratigraphically to trail /B/.  There are 28 of these; four
belong to the early Group 1 walls and the rest belong to Group 3,
which dates to AD 1730--1799, and Group 5, which dates to the early
nineteenth century.  Thus, the Bayesian calibration indicates that the
main thrust of field system intensification can be dated to the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  Much of it seems to be a
post-contact phenomenon.

This disparity between the hypothesized rise of /ali`i/ authority, as
intrepreted from /ali`i/ traditions, and field system intensification
is supported by evidence for development of the spatial structure of
the field system.  Application of graph theoretic principles to the
detailed study area indicates a structural break between trails /C/
and /D/ within Kahua 1 and not at the boundary of P\=ahinahina and
Kahua 1 as implied by an earlier analysis
[[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][Figure 1;]].  This
structural break was not closed until sometime after the curb for
trail /C/ was constructed, which the Bayesian calibration estimates at
AD 1770--1829.  The implication of this finding is that construction
projects were carried out in sub-regions of the field system whose
boundaries were not coincident with /ahupua`a/ boundaries until
relatively late in traditional Hawaiian times and quite possibly into
the post-contact era.  To the extent that /ali`i/ authority was
projected into the field system within /ahupua`a/ land units, this
result suggests that /ali`i/ authority played a late, largely
post-contact, role in construction of the field system.

A consideration of the tempo of change indicated by the Bayesian
calibration contraindicates the impression of regularity and
inevitability left by the chronology of the origin narrative.
Instead, the expansion of agriculture into the region made possible by
the late introduction of sweet potato was a fairly long, drawn out
affair that is imprecisely dated with current evidence.  This is a
period during which expert agriculturalists experimented with a new
crop plant in areas that had previously seen little, if any, use.
Presumably, it was at this time that the limits of rain-fed
cultivation of sweet potato were discovered---the arid boundary of the
lowland fields and the nutrient deficient boundary in the wet uplands
[[parencite:vitousek04:_soils_agric_and_societ_in_precon_hawaii][;]].
Some experimentation with agricultural walls in the late seventeenth
century indicate efforts, presumably successful, to control soil
moisture against the combined effects of strong winds and variability
in precipitation.  This long period of expansion and initial
experimentation was punctuated, probably early in the historic period,
by a period of intensive wall construction and field subdivision that
ended less than a century later when the field system was abandoned.
The irregular tempo of change revealed by the Bayesian calibration,
with a late burst of investment in the field system infrastructure
followed soon after by its abandonment, suggests the importance of
contingency in the history of agricultural development and raises the
possibility that the response to contingent events, which disrupted several
hundred years of apparently successful agricultural and social
development, was not in the end sustainable.

* Detailed Chronological Model                                     :noexport:
The model of the relative chronological information for the detailed
study area of the Leeward Kohala Field System (section [[Relative
Chronology of Development]]) and the \rc\space age determinations
(section [[\rc\space Dating]]) can be set within the framework of a
first-order cultural sequence for Hawai`i that was established using
Bayesian methods [[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii]].  The
first-order cultural sequence includes a pre-colonization period,
evidenced by dated material recovered during paleoenvironmental
coring, and a post-colonization period, evidenced by dates on
Polynesian-introduced materials from archaeological sites.  If we let
\alpha_pre and \beta_pre equal the early and late bounds of the
pre-colonization period, and \alpha_post and \beta_post equal the
early and late bounds of the post-colonization period, then a
first-order cultural history sequence for Hawai`i can be expressed
with model (\ref{eq:first-order}), which states that 
   1. the pre-colonization period began at a time too old for the
      \rc\space method to date;
   2. the colonization event simultaneously ended the pre-colonization
      period and began the post-colonization period; and
   3. the post-colonization period continues to the present, which
      following \rc\space dating convention
      [[parencite:stuiver-polach77][;]], is AD 1950.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:first-order}
\infty = \alpha_{pre} > \beta_{pre} = \alpha_{post} > \beta_{post} = 0
\end{equation}

The age of the colonization event was estimated using model (3)
of [[textcite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii]], which includes
seven \rc\space age determinations on floral and faunal materials
[[parencite:dyess:_model_age_estim_polyn_colon_hawaii][Table 1;]].

The dating program carried out by
[[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][;]] dated materials that were
collected from archaeological contexts stratigraphically older than
selected trail curbs and agricultural walls.  These results from the
detailed study area of the Leeward Kohala Field System can be fit into
the first-order cultural sequence in the following way. The graph
theoretic analysis in Section [[Relative Chronology of Development]]
identified and grouped features with equivalent relative stratigraphic
relations, creating six groups (fig. \ref{fig:digraph}).  The early
and late bounds of the pre-feature deposits in each group can be
specified as \alpha_n and \beta_n, respectively, where n = (1, 2, 3,
4, 5a, 5b).  Two undated features, trail /A/ and wall /h/, are
included in the model to establish stratigraphic relations among dated
features; these are indicated as the floating parameters \phi_A and
\phi_h, both of which were assigned uninformative prior probabilities
modeled as a uniform distribution AD 800-1950.  In addition, land
records indicate that the Leeward Kohala Field System was likely
abandoned by the middle of the nineteenth century.  This information
is included in the model with a floating parameter, \phi_abandon, that
is normally distributed at AD 1850 with a standard deviation of 10
years.

Each \beta_n provides an estimate for when the walls of Group /n/ were
built.   

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\beta_{pre} > \alpha_1 > \theta_{8-11} > \beta_1 > \beta_2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\alpha_2 > \theta_{22} > \beta_2 > \beta_3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
\alpha_3 > \theta_{12-14} > \beta_3 > \phi_A
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h}
\phi_h > \beta_4
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
\alpha_4 > \theta_{23} > \beta_4 > \beta_5b
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:A}
\phi_A > \beta_{5a}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5a}
\alpha_{5a} > \theta_{15, 16} > \beta_{5a} > \phi_{abandon}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5b}
\alpha_{5b} > \theta_{17, 18} > \beta_{5b} > \phi_{abandon}
\end{equation}

In addition, there are seven \rc\space age determinations from outside
the most intensively investigated portion of the field system.  These
age determinations provide information on the timing of gardening
activities, but don't usefully constrain the model set out above.
They are useful, however, to establish the onset of the Expansion
period. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:garden}
\beta_{pre} > \alpha_{garden} > \theta_{19-21, 25-28} > \beta_{garden} > \phi_{abandon}
\end{equation}

*** Chronological development of field systems, p. 153
    To sum up, the chronological development of the Kohala, Kona, Waimea,
    Kahikinui, and Kalaupapa field systems, spanning three islands, is
    remarkably congruent.  While there was some low intensity land use in
    Kohala and Kona prior to AD 1400, in all cases the onset of major
    dryland cultivation began around AD 1400.  Following about two
    centuries of development, a final phase of intensification, typically
    marked by highly formalized garden plots and territorial boundaries,
    commenced about AD 1600 to 1650, and continued until the early
    postcontact period.  Unlike the irrigation systems, many of which have
    continued in use throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
    the dryland field systems were all rapidly abandoned within a few
    decades following European contact.

*** Early archaeological sites, p. 126
    Only a single well-documented habitation site, with early forms of
    Eastern Polynesian artifacts (fishhooks, adzes), is arguably dated to
    this initial phase: the Bellows or O18 dune site at Waim\={a}nalo on
    windward O`ahu.

*** Traditional political history
- Assuming a 20 year generational interval and accepting Hommon's
  judgement that the last 21 generations of the /ali`i/
  genealogies are historically accurate takes the traditional
  history of the ali`i back to AD 1400 (which is one
  congruence). p. 81--82
- Ali`i history, in the western sense of the word "history,"
  begins in AD 1400
- AD 1600 marks the beginning of the first Gregorian century in
  which there were island paramounts on Maui and Hawai`i Island.
- `Umi a L\=iloa, whose reign helped legitimate Kamehameha's
  usurpation, ruled at about this time.

** Notes
   The table adj-lkfs is an adjacency matrix of the LKFS, where a 1
   indicates that the row feature is older than the column feature.

   The table includes all the stratigraphic relationships that can be
   gleaned from the map of the site.  It can be transformed into a matrix
   where transitive relations are removed using an algorithm suggested by
   Peter Langfelder on the comp.lang.r listserve.

   I assume your adjacency matrix is unweighted, i.e. contains only
   entries 0 and 1.

   Don't know of a function, but the algorithm isn't very difficult - if
   no one suggests a better way, just code it yourself. For example, for
   3 variables, start with vector c(1, 0, 0). If you multiply it by the
   adjacency matrix, you will get c(0, 1, 1), that is, u is connected to
   v and w. If you multiply it by the adjacency again, you will get
   c(0,0,1) because v is connected w but w is not connected to anything.
   So you can get from u to w in two steps (via v) and so the link (u, w)
   should be deleted. For a 3x3 adjacency that's all you get but if you
   have more nodes, simply continue multiplying by the adjacency and
   deleting edges from the starting link to whatever has a 1 in one of
   the resulting vectors. You need to multiply at most n-1 times since an
   DAG cannot have a path length more than n-1. Then do the same thing
   starting from c(0,1,0), starting from c(0,0,1) etc.

   If my algorithm doesn't work I apologize :)

* Calibration model                                                :noexport:
** Description
   The digraph of the field system can be used as a guide to creating
   calibration groups.  The digraph puts the dated features in relative
   order, not absolute order, i.e., features at the same level aren't
   necessarily the same age.  Groups are more restrictive than this, they
   are formed on the basis of shared immediate parents/children.

   Six groups of dated features can be formed, and these are indicated in
   the [[Date table]] by the group column.  In addition, there are two
   floating parameters, chronological components of the model that lack
   associated \rc\space age determinations.  These are wall h and trail A.

   Note that the following model can't be implemented precisely with
   BCal.  The overlapping earlier/later pairs order both the boundaries,
   we only specify one boundary relation, the \beta parameters.  So, our
   analysis can't rely automatically on the \alpha parameters.  It will
   require \alpha_1, however, as an estimate of the establishment of
   swidden gardens in the LKFS.  The \rc\space age determinations for
   this group include the two oldest dates, so it appears this limitation
   of the BCal software won't have an effect on the calibration.

    - \alpha_1 > \theta_{8 \dots 11} > \beta_1
    - \alpha_2 > \theta_22 > \beta_2
    - \alpha_3 > \theta_{12 \dots 14} > \beta_3
    - \beta_2 > \phi_h > \beta_4
    - \alpha_4 > \theta_23 > \beta_4
    - \beta_3 > \phi_A > \beta_5a
    - \alpha_5a > \theta_{15, 16} > \beta_5a
    - \alpha_5b > \theta_{17, 18} > \beta_5b
    - \beta_1 > \beta_2 > \beta_3
    - \beta_4 > \beta_5b

   This chronological model fits into the regional picture, as follows:

   - [ ] \beta_pre > \alpha_1
   - [ ] \beta_{5a, 5b} > \phi_abandon = AD 1850 \pm 10
   - [ ] \beta_pre > \alpha_garden > \theta_{19-21, 25-28} > \beta_garden > \phi_abandon

   In the analysis, the following relations will be important:
- the time interval between \beta_pre and \alpha_garden is an estimate of the
  hiatus between colonization of the islands and first use of the
  field system for farming
- the time interval between \alpha_1 and \beta_1 is an estimate of
  the duration of the swidden gardening period
- the time interval between \beta_1 and \beta_{5a, 5b} is an
  estimate of the duration of the intensification period

**** Is Beta-208141 an outlier?
  Beta-2018141 was clearly identified by the procedure as the \rc\space
     age determination most likely to represent an outlier.  Its posterior
     probability of 30% represents an increase over the prior probability
     that is about 2.5 times greater than the next highest one, Beta-20852b
     with a posterior probability of 18%.  It might be tempting to toss it
     out, as Ladefoged and Graves appear to have done, but there are
     several reasons why this temptation should be resisted.  First, the
     dating model typically has very few age determinations per group,
     which makes it more difficult to identify outliers.  Second, is that
     the charcoal under the walls and trail curbs was created during the
     period of swidden gardening.  One might expect that much of the
     charcoal in this deposit came from the initial forest clearing and
     that later fallow periods contributed less.  This would be especially
     true if the secondary growth during fallow was used as a source of
     mulch and was not burned prior to initiation of a new cropping cycle.
     If this situation, a random sample of the true ages of charred
     materials under the walls and curbs would fairly regularly yield a
     sample distribution similar to the one observed in the data.

     This is clearly something that deserves more research and the
     identification and dating of additional samples.

** Application of graph theory
Application of the Harris matrix to the relative chronological
relations among agricultural walls and trails in the detailed study
area of the Leeward Kohala Field System yields a strictly
chronological division of features into building phases.  Formulation
of the Harris matrix in graph theoretic terms opens up a path for its
potential application on a broader geographic scale than the detailed
study area.  All that is required is a list of observed stratigraphic
relations among uniquely identified features.  Much of the analysis
can be automated with the aid of computer graph algorithms capable of
dealing in a precise way with complex situations of virtually any
size.


** Trail construction sequences, 2003 and 2008
   This table shows the ordering of the trails in 2003 and 2008.
   Although 2008 distinguished 5 building phases, there were no phase 1
   trails, so the trail construction sequence had 4 phases.  The 2003
   model had four phases, labeled with letters.  I've changed the letters
   to numbers and decremented by 1 the phases given to the trails in 2008
   to produce similar development scales.  Out of the 7 trails shared by
   the two analyses, 4 maintain their ranks and 3 others change.  Trails
   A and B switch relative positions in the first and second phases and
   trail F moves from the first phase to the third.

   | Trail | 2003 name | 2003 | 2008 |
   | A     |         8 | 1    |  2   |
   | B     |         7 | 2    |  1   |
   | C     |         6 | 4    |  4   |
   | D     |         5 | 3    |  3   |
   | E     |         4 | 4    |  4   |
   | F     |         3 | 1    |  3   |
   | G     |         2 | 2    |  2   |
   |       |         1 | 3    |      |

   Conclude that the ordering method doesn't yield stable results, but
   appears to change depending on the area under consideration and
   perhaps other factors, as well.

** Comparison with L&G
- Initial use possibly by 1290, certainly by 1430
- probability 1290 contained in depositional phase 1 = 0.31
- 1430 = 0.84
- Two Phase 1 walls built by 1410-1630 (this is probably too strong
   because it neglects the possibility that the youngest charcoal
   under the wall was not dated--expect that older charcoal is present.)
- The majority of the agricultural walls were built after 1660
- Agreed, the probability that 1660 is contained in depositional
  phase 1 = 0.82, thus it is very likely that Phase 1 walls were
  still being built after this time (and thus that later phase walls
  were also being built).
** Space and Time in Kohala
*** The Biocomplexity Project in Hawaiian Archaeology
    Over the last several decades the great bulk of archaeological work in
    Kohala has been performed within the context of cultural resources
    management.  Overwhelmingly, this work is designed to satisfy a
    developer's desire to meet minimum state standards at minimum cost.
    As a result, the work is designed largely without reference to the
    questions and research results that drive academic research in the
    region.  This lack of integration, whose cause I place squarely on the
    flawed design of state archaeology rules
    [[parencite:dye04:_how_to_fix_inven_survey_rule]], makes it difficult for
    academics to use the CRM literature productively.  Thus, the theory
    and method worked out in the academy is often based on a partial
    understanding of the documented archaeological record.
    [[textcite:hommon10_watershed]] attempts to bridge this gap with a research
    design for cultural resources management archaeologists.

    The Biocomplexity Project has its genesis in the Lapakahi research
    project carried out at the University of Hawai`i forty years ago.  The
    settlement pattern approach that Roger Green brought to the Lapakahi
    project has been fleshed out and extended, often brilliantly, by the
    Biocomplexity Project.

    The papers we've heard today represent attempts as the project winds
    down to build upon the project's substantial results and to point in
    new research directions.  I'd like to review them from two
    perspectives, concentrating first on their contributions to our
    understanding of variability across space, and then from the
    perspective of how we understand change over time.
*** Contributions to Understanding Space
*** Contributions to Understanding Time
*** Marxist Critique
    The Biocomplexity project has, to a certain extent, situated its
    investigation of change within the emergence of state politics in
    Hawai`i.  This line of inquiry concerns itself with how society's
    elite organize themselves to govern, how authority is legitimated and
    enforced, etc.  From this point of view, the change from a typical
    Polynesian lineage organization seems revolutionary, or as an
    "ultimate crisis between a society organized on the principles of
    kinship, and one dictated by the structures of hierarchy and chiefly
    power" (Field et al. p. 54).  What is missing from this analysis is
    the content of the changes.  How did daily practice change during and
    after the "ultimate crisis?"  Note first that the theory doesn't
    predict any change in the content of relations.  All that is required
    is that an ali`i assert some claim outside the bounds of traditional
    lineage practice--"I lay claim to your ho`okupu for reasons other than
    our connection as kin."  The ho`okupu being claimed by the political
    ali`i might be exactly what the ali`i related as kin would have
    claimed.  The organizational crisis that gave birth to the state might
    have made very little difference in the daily life of a maka`ainana.

    I bring this up because I think we need to hold open the possibility
    that many of the day-to-day practices worked out over generations in
    the context of the old lineage organization were still active after
    the organizational crisis and the emergence of the state.  In my view,
    this is what McCoy et al. have shown with the distribution of
    Pu`uwa`awa`a glass and what Mills and his colleagues are showing with
    the slowly emerging picture of adze rock distribution.  McCoy's work
    is especially impressive.  Mills's still missing source data.

    The framework of the state is an abstraction.  What was the content?
    How did this change?

**** Interpretation
 - This is really interesting
 - The first phase of elaboration in the Kohala field system ended
   in the latter half of the seventeenth century or early in the
   eighteenth century
 - The bulk of the elaboration, if not all of it, was accomplished
   during the eighteenth century
 - Much of it was clearly post-Cook

** Original conclusion
   The model based calibration provides a framework for estimating the
   chronology of use and development of the leeward Kohala field system
   in the context of Polynesian settlement.  The history of the leeward
   Kohala field system is divided into three periods: an initial period
   after Polynesian settlement when the area was either unused or used at
   such a low level of intensity that archaeologists have not been able
   to detect it; a period of use prior to the construction of
   agricultural walls; and, finally, construction of the walls that
   characterize the field system as it is known to us today.  The
   Bayesian calibration is used to estimate the duration of the three
   periods, in order to illustrate the tempo of change and to indicate
   the uncertainty of the estimates.

   The results of the calibration indicate that, for most of its history,
   the area of the leeward Kohala field system was either unused, or used
   in a way that didn't include construction of agricultural walls (table
   \ref{tab:duration}).  The results of the Bayesian calibration are
   relatively imprecise at this stage of the investigation and analysis
   of the leeward Kohala field system.  The pre-use period may have been
   as short as two centuries or as long as seven.  Use of the area before
   walls were constructed might have been a relatively brief century and
   a half, or it could have been six and a half.  In contrast, the period
   of wall construction was relatively brief, covering at most the final
   two centuries of the traditional Hawaiian era, but possibly as short
   as 50 years.  The ability to measure the uncertainty of a cultural
   chronology is one of the real benefits of a model-based analysis.

#+CAPTION: Cultural periods and their estimated durations
#+LABEL: tab:duration

   | Early parameter | Late parameter | Period       | Duration |
   |-----------------+----------------+--------------+----------|
   | \phi_1          | \alpha_1       | pre-use      |  195-686 |
   | \alpha_1        | \beta_1        | pre-wall use |  147-650 |
   | \beta_1         | \phi_2         | wall use     |   50-217 |

   The model-based calibration points the way to future research in the
   leeward Kohala field system.  The most pressing need at this point is
   dates from contexts associated with the pre-use and wall use periods.
   Improvements to the precision of estimates for \alpha_1 and \beta_1
   can be expected to have a beneficial effect on the precision of the
   cultural chronology as a whole.

   Charcoal from the pre-use period might be identifiable
   stratigraphically as pockets of charcoal left from initial clearing of
   the dryland forest presumably growing here before the area was cleared
   for agriculture.  Lacking this fortuitous stratigraphic information,
   however, a detailed analysis of wood charcoal might identify taxa
   reasonably believed to have been part of the dryland forest, but a
   priori unlikely to have been part of the secondary growth during
   fallow periods.  Dated material from the pre-use period will
   potentially constrain the long early tails on the estimates of
   \alpha_1, and in this way reduce the uncertainty of time estimates for
   both the pre-use and pre-wall use periods.

   Similarly, dated contexts associated with the period of wall use can
   be used to constrain the estimated age of \beta_1.  Such material
   might already be available from habitation contexts where an enclosing
   wall or some other structure is stratigraphically superior to an old
   agricultural wall.  Although the constraints introduced by dated
   contexts in the wall use period are likely to have less effect on the
   cultural chronology than dates from the pre-use period, they will go a
   long way to ameliorating the effects on calibration of the Industrial
   Revolution, which flattened the recent end of the calibration curve.
   Here, the more stratigraphic information that can be introduced to the
   calibration, the better.


   In this vein, it might be worthwhile to carry out an intensive dating
   project in a local area small enough to ensure that the wall
   construction chronology uniquely orders the agricultural walls.  Such
   a project would try to secure for dating the /youngest/ material
   beneath each wall, so that the resulting estimate of when the wall was
   built is as precise as possible.  One step might be to date only
   materials likely to have grown as weeds during the period of pre-wall
   use to minimize the probability that re-worked older material from
   initial clearing is dated inadvertently.  Even with this approach,
   however, it seems likely that the problem of securing the youngest
   material beneath each wall will require some sort of a sampling
   approach, which is likely to be expensive.

** SQLite
*** BCal results

**** General idea
     Use R to read the CSV files from BCal, normalize them with a
     descriptive label using this record structure, and save to SQLite table:
- id : integer
- label : char[25]
- phase : integer
- cal.BP : integer
- posterior.probability : float
  The tables will be used subsequently to create plots.  There should be
  information for one plot per SQLite table.

*** 14C plots
    Revise the 14C plotting routines so they each take a SQLite table as
    input and plot all the results in the table.

*** Bootstrap results
    Use or generate a population of walls by phase. Generate the phases in
    order.  For each wall, randomly select a BCal result from the same
    phase and randomly select a construction date from cal.BP weighted by
    the posterior.probability and subject to the condition that it cannot
    be older than the oldest wall of the previous phase.  Place the result
    in a SQLite record with this structure:
- id : integer
- run : integer
- phase : integer
- cal.BP : integer
  and store each record in a database named for the experiment.

**** Graphic to summarize each bootstrap run
Write a graph routine that shows a barchart of wall construction
events by phase.  Use this to look at the results of each run.

**** Graphic to summarize each bootstrap experiment
This can be a series of box and whisker plots that show the
distribution for each interval, regardless of wall phase.  Or, could
generate one for each wall phase.

** Queries for Thegn (or his published works)

*** Distribution of walls by phase
- LKFS
- Two ahupua`a with dates
  Need how many walls in each phase.
  Are these samples or populations?
  If they are samples, then I'll need an estimate of now many walls
  there are so I can bootstrap the right sizes
  If they are populations, then I'll use them directly as guides for the
  bootstrap

Table \ref{tab:trails} shows the different ordering of the trails in
the detailed study area at P\=ahinahina and Kahua 1, keyed to Figure
\ref{fig:diagram}.  The order proposed by
[[textcite:ladefoged03:_archaeol_eviden_for_agric_devel]] is shown in
the third column of the table, and the order proposed by
[[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]] is shown in the fourth column
of the table.  For ease of
comparison, columns 3 and 4 in the table indicate the relative
ordering of the trails on a common scale.  Comparison of these
columns shows that four of the seven trails shared by the two analyses
maintain their ranks and three change.  Trails /A/ and /B/
(fig. \ref{fig:diagram}) switch relative positions in the first two
trail building phases.  The change is more dramatic for trail /F/
(fig. \ref{fig:diagram}), which moves from the first building phase
to the third.  These results indicate that the procedures used over
the years by Ladefoged, Graves, and their colleagues haven't yielded
consistent chronological results.

** Scraps
The history of archaeological investigation of the Leeward Kohala
Field System, beginning with the work of [[textcite:newman70][;]] in
the 1960's and extending through the detailed investigations of the
Hawai`i Biocomplexity Project is admirably summarized by
[[textcite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system]].  Investigation of
relative chronological relations among the field system features was
initiated by [[textcite:rosendahl72]], who pointed out that trails
that ran over a wall were younger than the wall, and that walls that
abutted a trail were younger than the trail.  The great potential of
the approach was impressed on archaeologists by Kirch's publication of
a graphic that showed a portion of the field system at three points in
time \parencites[[multicite:kirch85][234;]][[multicite:kirch84][185;]].
[[textcite:ladefoged00:_kohala_fields]] suggested that the process of
ordering features could be simplified if wall length were used as a
proxy for age.  They later compared this simplified method unfavorably
to more detailed methods that relied on stratigraphic relations
[[parencite:ladefoged:_leewar_kohal_field_system][100;]].
[[textcite:ladefoged03:_archaeol_eviden_for_agric_devel]] returned to
the detailed stratigraphic relations in three study areas, including
the one at P\=ahinahina and Kahua 1 that was later the site of a
detailed dating program (fig. \ref{fig:diagram}).  This work proposed
a series of rules that could be used to assign field system features
to one of four temporal phases.  Later, when the P\=ahinahina and
Kahua 1 study area was selected for excavation and detailed dating,
additional field observations led to a five phase proposal
[[parencite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]], which differed from the
earlier phasing.

The map prepared as part of the detailed dating program
[[parencite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii][Figure 7;]] classifies field
system features in five building phases (see Fig. \ref{fig:diagram}).
Detailed inspection of the map indicates that the building phases are
not strictly chronological.  This can be seen most clearly in walls
that abut Trail /B/ in Figure \ref{fig:diagram}.  In particular, there
is no published stratigraphic information to support the proposition
that the building phase 2 walls on the left hand, or P\=ahinahina,
side of Trail /B/ in Figure \ref{fig:diagram}, are older than the
building phase 4 walls on the right hand, or Kahua 1 side, of the
trail.  Similarly, there is no stratigraphic evidence that the
building phase 3 walls on the left hand side of Trail /B/ are older
than the building phase 5 walls on the right hand side of the trail.
In fact, there appears to be no logical way to determine the relative
ages of these two sets of walls.  That the procedures used by
[[textcite:ladefoged08:_variab_hawaii]] assign relative ages to them
indicates that the results they yield aren't strictly chronological.

** Natbib citation commands
The citation commands supported by natbib all start with =cite= and
end with one or more letters that indicate a style.  The most commonly
used commands are:
  1. [[latex:progstruct][citep]] for parenthetical citations, e.g., (Jones, 1958);
  2. [[latex:progstruct][citet]] for textual citations, e.g., Jones (1958);
  3. [[latex:progstruct][citealt]] for textual citations without parentheses, e.g. Jones 1958.
There are starred versions of most commands that will output the full
author lists rather than use the abbreviation =et. al.=
